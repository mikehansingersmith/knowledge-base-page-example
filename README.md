#knoweldge-base-page-example
This is an example of a type of knowledge base page I used to develop in my previous role with Inland Revenue, NZ.

I worked as part of a team that developed thousands of pages like this one that were used as an online Q&A repository the call center staff would access in order to answer customer enquiries.
